# Dev-Blog

CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well! This is a full-stack program that follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Installation

* Pull the repository 
* Install dependencies by typing the following in the terminal: npm i
